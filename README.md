Generic SQL Historian library that can be used to implement a historian agent with a relational database backend. 
This library cannot be installed as a VOLTTRON agent as is. Only a concrete database implementation package such as 
[sqlite-historian](https://github.com/eclipse-volttron/volttron-sqlitehistorian) that depends on this library can be 
installed as a VOLTTRON agent.


## Requirements

 - Python >= 3.8

## Installation

Create and activate a virtual environment.

```shell
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Installing volttron-listener requires a running volttron instance.

```shell
pip install volttron

# Start platform with output going to volttron.log
volttron -vv -l volttron.log &
```

Install and start the volttron-listener.

```shell
vctl install volttron-listener --start
```

View the status of the installed agent

```shell
vctl status
```

## Development

Developing on this agent requires poetry 1.2.2 or greater be used.  One can install it from https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation.  The VOLTTRON team prefers to have the python environments created within the project directory.  Execute
this command to make that behavior the default.

```shell
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
```

Clone the repository.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/eclipse-volttron/volttron-listener
```

Change to the repository directory and use poetry install to setup the environment.

```shell
cd volttron-listener
poetry install
```

### Building Wheel

To build a wheel from this project execute the following:

```shell
poetry build
```

The wheel and source distribution will be located in the ```./dist/``` directory.

### Bumping version number of project

To bump the version number of the project execute one of the following.

```shell
# patch, minor, major, prepatch, preminor, premajor, prerelease

# use patch
user@path$ poetry patch

# output
Bumping version from 0.2.0-alpha.0 to 0.2.0

# use prepatch
user@path$ poetry version prepatch

# output
Bumping version from 0.2.0 to 0.2.1-alpha.0
```
